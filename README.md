## PROJECT NAME: Planetary Gravity Ball Drop Simulator

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This is a simple console-based simulator that shows how gravity works differently across the planets in our solar system. 
The idea is straightforward: you drop a ball from a tower, and the program tells you how high the ball is at each second 
for the first 5 seconds. What makes it interesting is that you can pick from eight planets, and the simulator uses each 
planet’s actual gravitational pull to calculate the results. The project started out as a way for me to get more comfortable 
with C++17—especially Object-Oriented Programming and user input handling by modeling the height of a ball dropped from a tower-
but it turned into a fun way to mix programming with real-world physics when I got the idea to model gravity for different planets. 
By applying a basic physics formula (distance fallen = ½ × g × t²), I got a better understanding of both how motion works and how to 
turn it into working code. It also gave me a chance to think about error-checking, user experience, and keeping my code organized.

## FEATURES:
- Simulates how a ball falls on different planets using real gravity values
- Lets the user input the tower height and choose a planet
- Prints the height of the ball at each second from 0 to 5
- Includes basic input validation to catch mistakes
- Organized with clear, modular functions for readability and reuse

## TOOLS:
- C++17
- Microsoft Visual Studio
- C++ Standard Library
- Physics
